<CENTER><H3>AN IMPORTANT HISTORY:</H3></CENTER>
<P>Originally, the territory of Alaska was colonized by Russia and later sold to the United States in 1867. Its capital is Juneau, and it was incorporated as a state of our neighboring northern country in 1959, being the penultimate entity to achieve this. Its total population is just over 750 thousand inhabitants.

The same name of Alaska describes its essence because the word means "big land" or "the object against which the action of the sea is directed", according to the Aleutian word alyeska or alaxsxaq from which it takes its name.
Alaska has two natural phenomena that can only be seen in specific parts of the world: the northern lights and the midnight sun.

The aurora borealis is an atmospheric phenomenon in which spots of different colors appear in the sky due to radiation. On the other hand, the midnight sun occurs in summer, while (due to the position of the earth during the movement of translation) the days have 19 hours of sunlight.</P>

<H4>Day 1:ANCHORAGE</H4>
<P>We did not have high expectations for Anchorage, however we found a medium, quiet city with all the modern comforts. On our first day we picked up the car and bought the necessary things for the road trip ahead of us.
From the city we got to know the center, with its picturesque and flower-filled streets at this time of year, the Earthquake Park, named after the great earthquake that destroyed an entire neighborhood, the Ship Creek where fishermen go to try their luck with salmon and Kincaid Park where we expected to see moose but instead the tour took us on beautiful paths to the beach.
In Anchorage we additionally experience the “midnight sun” phenomenon for the first time, officially at this time of year the sun sets at 11:40 pm and rises again at 4:30 am, however it never really got dark. , which was a novelty for us, used to the days and nights of almost equal duration in Colombia.</P>

<H4>Day 2: FROM ANCHORAGE TO DENALI</H4>
<P>This 380 km route has some interesting points along the way, the main attraction is seeing Mount Denali, the highest peak in North America at 6,190 meters above sea level. We could see it at times and after a dense fog since there have been many forest fires and much of the visibility is lost due to the smoke.
Denali is considered by many to be the most difficult mountain to climb in the world. Despite not being as high as Mount Everest, its geographic location so far north makes temperatures even more extreme. In summer it is possible that -40 degrees Celsius are registered at night and in winter it is practically a suicide to attempt the ascent. Each season 1,500 people are issued permits and this year almost 50% have successfully reached the top.</P>

<H4>DENALI NATIONAL PARK</H4>
<P>This park was established in 1917 to protect its fragile ecosystem. There is a 120 km highway that allows access to a large part of the park, however individuals cannot go beyond kilometer 24 and since the 80's a bus transport system was established with two options: green ones to move around and coffee for guided tours.
It is important to note that the park is very large and the population of animals, although important, is not so high as to have permanent encounters with them. However, the park is in balance, the animals that the ecosystem can support live.</P>

<H4>GLACER VIEW</H4>
<P>This small population of less than 300 inhabitants is actually a settlement of different services along the road. The main attraction is the Matanuska Glacier, the most accessible in the United States. Although it is possible to visit the glacier independently, we chose an excursion with the Mica company that would allow us to walk on the glacier and reach some inaccessible areas without the proper equipment. On the almost 4-hour tour we were able to get a little deeper into the base of the glacier and observe the beautiful formations that transform every day.

Glaciers form with the constant accumulation of snow on top of the mountains. As the snow compacts, it begins to move down the slopes, in a process that takes hundreds of years. This particular glacier is 43km long and 6.4km at its widest. Every day it moves 30 cm and is receding permanently due to global warming.</P>
