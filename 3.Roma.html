<CENTER><H3>AN IMPORTANT HISTORY:</H3></CENTER>
<P>Rome is built on 7 hills: Aventine, Capitoline, Celium, Aeschino, Palatine, Quirinal and Vibal.
An ancient Roman would tell you that gladiator shows were fine ... but that the starting point was the pana Naumachie ’. They were representations of naval battles, for which they flooded squares and even the Colosseum itself (in Piazza Navona a few were made).
Rome was not the first capital of the Kingdom of Italy, but before it was Turin and Florence. It is the year 1871 when it is established there.
If you want to look like a Roman instead of a tourist when you drink from the nasonis (the water sources scattered throughout the city) do not duck: the correct way is to plug the spout so that the water rises up through a hole.
One of the most beloved drinks in Ancient Rome was the Conditum Paradoxum, prepared with wine, honey, and spices. Today the spritz is in fashion.
The Romans were the first to invent the profession of the hairdresser: it is said that Hadrian never left the house without his curls well placed.
Life expectancy in Ancient Rome was around 30-35 years.
Brides, in ancient Rome, dressed in a white dress and red veil.
Emperor Caligula had his horse declared a senator.
Campo de´ Fiori, which today is one of the most cheerful and colorful spots in Rome, has a dark past: in 1,600 it was the center of public executions.
One of the most famous executions was that of the philosopher Giordano Bruno, considered a heretic, among other things because he claimed that the sun was a star. (Today his statue can be seen in the Campo de´ Fiori square itself).</P>

	<LI><P>The restaurant was opened in 1936 by grandfather. But he kept the father's name. The fact is that the Trivelloni family has been behind their trattoria all their lives. After Guido before and Felice later, it is now Franco (the son) who is in charge of the restaurant: "Our specialty is tonnarelli cacio e pepe" (a kind of spaghetti with cheese and pepper). It is not for less: many consider them the best in the city.</P></LI>
	<LI><P>As the bad news is given before the good news, here is the bad drink: it is the most expensive restaurant on this list of essentials, since the account will cost around 50 or 60 euros per person. But Da Cesare compensates the damage to the portfolio with an exquisite recipe that has remained identical since 1965. "We have the best meat in Italy", boasts Armando Arrigoni, son of the founder Cesare and manager, along with his brother Alessandro, of the local. And by the way, he recommends ordering some rigatoni with stufato di chianina (pasta with meat stew) or a risotto alla pescatora (rice with fish).</P></LI>
	<LI><P>In the year 55 BC, the consul Pompeo had a theater built right in the center of the city. And, like everything at that time, it did it in a big way: with huge steps, the building could accommodate up to 40,000 people. Today there are hardly any remains of the theater. But in the same place, a great show made of Roman wines and gastronomy is staged every day. Where Pompeo's gift to Rome was found centuries ago, today is a tribute to his palate: Hostaria Costanza.</P></LI>

<CENTER><H3>ITINERARY</H3></CENTER>
<H4>Day 1:</H4>
<P>We stayed in an apartment in the Rioni Parione, in the very center of Rome. If this is your case, the first day you could start by visiting Campo de Fiori, a busy square where, in the morning, a local market is set up. Although throughout the day the bustle here is constant.
It then passes through the sacred area of ​​Largo di Torre Argentina, where the ruins of the Teatro Pompeyo rest, the place where Julio Cesar was assassinated. The owners and lords of these ruins today are very nice kittens and loved by all the neighbors.
In its vicinity we can visit the church of San Luis de los Franceses, with some famous paintings by Caravaggio, or Sant’Ivo alla Sapienza and its magnificent Borromini dome. Do not linger too long because we still have many things to see.
The next stop will be the Panteon, the area where it is located is full of architectural treasures, if you have time you can visit one of them such as the church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva, one of the few Gothic churches in Rome. Don't miss the Obelisk of the Minerva, with an elephant at its base, outside the church either.
Unintentionally we are approaching the Trevi Fountain, which will appear imposing before us after walking through narrow alleys. Do not forget to throw a coin and make sure your return to Rome.
If you were well enough time you could go to the Quirinal Palace (13), residence of the President of the Republic, with beautiful views of Rome (especially at sunset). Although we advise you to head north towards Piazza di Spagna, and its famous staircase that connects it to the Trinità dei Monti church..</P>

<H4>Day 2:</H4>
<P>Very early we went to the great protagonist of Imperial Rome: the Roman Coliseum. And it is best to go early because the queues that are mounted here are from aupa! The € 12 entry entitles you to enter the Colosseum, the Forum and the Palatine. But first look around the impressive Arch of Constantine.
The Roman Forum and Palatine will be our next visits. We recommend spending the whole morning, without haste, attending to the details and imagining that, where we are treading, the hustle and bustle of the day to day in the capital of the Empire was developing.
From there we can direct our steps along the Via dei Fori Imperiali, leaving aside the Forum and Trajan's Market and we will arrive at the enormous and delicate Trajan Column. You can eat in this area, although stay away from the restaurants closest to the Colosseum, which will be the most expensive! A pizza place in a trancio is not a bad option.
Very close is the Piazza Venezia, epicenter of the means of transport of the center of Rome. Here the Palace of Venice stands out on one side, from where Musolini launched his harangues to the Italian people, and the impressive Monument to Vittorio Emanuele II. Do not forget to visit the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and, if you want, pay the entrance to access its terrace by elevator and see the Forum and the Colosseum from another point of view.With a full belly it is time to continue our route and we do it visiting the Capitoline Hill, crowned by the Plaza del Campidoglio. Countless surprises await us, from the La Cordonata staircase to the Capitoline Museums, which are worth spending a couple of hours on. Don't leave without peeking out the back of these buildings, to have stunning views of the Forum and the Palatine.</P>

<H4>Day 3:</H4>
<P>"Let's go to the Vatican! The ideal is to arrive on foot, go walking across the Sant’Angelo Bridge over the Tiber, and passing through the curious Castel Sant’Angelo, linked to the events of the Pontifical State throughout history. By the way, the huge building you will leave on your right is the Corte Suprema di Cassazione.
Here you can visit Saint Peter's Square and Saint Peter's Basilica.
From here we will descend, not without skipping the Fontana dell’Acqua Paola, which will sound like the song “Roma Capoccia” by Antonello Venditti.
The heart is the Basilica of Santa María in Trastevere, although the best way to get to know the neighborhood is to stroll through its streets and discover its secret corners.
You can stop in small and charming churches scattered around the area, such as the iconic Convent of S. Maria della Scala, or the San Pietro in Montorio shrine, a work of Bramante de and the Catholic Monarchs to commemorate the birth of their son.</P>
