<CENTER><H3>AN IMPORTANT HISTORY:</H3></CENTER>
<P>The official name of Mexico is United Mexican States. The name is relatively new, since in 1821, after the independence of the Spanish empire, it was agreed to call the country the Mexican Empire. Three years later, in 1824, having as a paradigm the United States of America as the example of freedom and democracy, the constituents decided to adapt the name of the United States to the Mexican Republic.
Mexico is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire. This causes a strong seismic and volcanic activity in the country.
The border between the United States and Mexico is the second largest in the world, after which it divides Canada and the United States.
Mexico City was built on the ruins of the Great Tenochtitlán (Aztec city) and on what was a huge lake. This has caused the city to gradually sink, having to constantly reinforce the architectural structures.
Mexico City is one of the oldest in America.
More than 20 million 843 thousand inhabitants live in Mexico City. This makes it, according to the UN, the fourth most populous city in the world. Above are Tokyo, the most populated in the world with 37 million 833 thousand inhabitants; Delhi, with 24 million 953 thousand inhabitants, and Shanghai with 22 million 991 thousand inhabitants.

	<LI><P>It is the emblem of the gastronomic project directed by the restaurateur Alejandra Flores and the chef Jorge Vallejo, and whose purpose is to express in its menu the flavors of the ingredients of the Mexican territory under a personal perspective.
    Since 2015, Quintonil has been on the list of The 50 Best Wold’s Restaurants, where he currently ranks 11th worldwide and 9th in the Latin America’s 50 Best Wold’s Restaurants.</P></LI>
	<LI><P>It is in a house from the 50s that boasts grills, rotisseries and wood ovens where the main cooking is done; a comal for handmade tortillas and a brick oven for barbecue and other dishes where smoke is the essential ingredient.
    The six-course tasting menu preserves some dishes from the previous menu such as the mother mole from thousands of days of cooking, but incorporates new ones such as lobster sope or lamb in mint mole. In addition, there is the option of choosing a taco omakase, whose menu includes six tacos paired with six beers. Chef Enrique Olvera's favorite is the cauliflower taco with salsa macha.</P></LI>
	<LI><P>In Ensenada, Baja California, right in the heart of the Guadalupe Valley, in an almost lunar landscape where you could not believe that anything can grow, is the Villa del Valle. Inside, in addition to wonderful views, is one of the great projects of chef Diego Hernández Baquedano: Corazón de Tierra. The menu of this place changes in relation to the harvest of its garden, as well as the availability of ingredients from small local producers.</P></LI>

<H4>Day 3:FRIDA KAHLO MUSEUM</H4>
<P>"I will never, in all my life, forget your presence. You took me in pieces and gave me back whole, whole. " Frida Kahlo
How can I not visit the house of an artist who felt as much and gave as much as Frida? A true icon of modern Mexican art.
That is why visiting the Frida Kahlo house museum is a mandatory stop like eating tacos. Located in one of the most beautiful and oldest neighborhoods in Mexico City, the Casa Azul was converted into a museum in 1958, just a few years after the painter's death. Here are some of the most important works of the artist, such as: Viva la Vida (1954), Frida and the cesarean section (1931), Portrait of my father Wilhem Kahlo (1952), among others.</P>
